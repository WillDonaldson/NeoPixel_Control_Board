v1.0.0	20-10-2021	Initial design	
v1.1.0	21-10-2021	Due to cost of 1oz/ft^2 vs 2oz/ft^2 copper on small runs, decided to change initial design to use only 1oz/ft^2. To maintain a high current capability at 1oz/ft^2 the 5V traces (on top and bottom) were increased to 3.45mm from the previous 2.54mm. This allows 14A with a 23C temp rise when 5V trace is looped on both sides (effectively 2oz/ft^2)
v1.2.0  09-11-2021	Moved potentiometer_select pins from D1, D2 to D0, D8. Added IO pins for I2C, TX/RX (bluetooth), power, updated text information
