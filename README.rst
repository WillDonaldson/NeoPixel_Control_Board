NeoPixel Control Board
======================

NeoPixel Control Board is a modular, customizable PCB breakout board for controlling multiple strips of NeoPixels via an NodeMCU ESP8266. Additionally there are user input options to control the speed and brightness of the display with potentiometers and control the animation mode with a push button.

This project serves as a beginner friendly resource in developing custom PCBs. Below are the links to a 3 part tutorial series on how this board was created in Fusion 360 Electrical.

This project serves as an entertaining demo application of how the NeoPixel control board can be used. YouTube video here: (video to be published 16/12/2021).
In this repo there are the files used to laser cut the frame, as seen in the video and example software. Note that the the frame will only fit my PC case, you will most likely need to modify the design to fit your PC.
